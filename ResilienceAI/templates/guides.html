      Remember, the chat history is visible to the bot, allowing you to ask questions and receive answers with justification and evidence provided by the reference in the context used for the answer. It serves as a robust instrument for collaborative issue resolution and knowledge dissemination, fostering an environment where access to pertinent information is streamlined for optimal efficiency.
